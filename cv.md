### PROFILE 
My latest job had little to do with IT, it was more about finances.  

But at some point I got curious about programming, especially because many people called it 'a new essential skill'.  And the more I read and heard about programming in general, the more I felt it was not just a trendy thing but something that really could help to make things easier.  

My dream job would be more practical than theoretical, so that I could see the actual results of my work.
Also it would be great to have around people who are sincerely enthusiastic about what they do.

I believe that IT is something that can lead me there, so I decided to give myself a chance, dive in and see if I can become a solid specialist in this field.
